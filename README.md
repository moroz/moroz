### Hello World 👋🌍

My name is Karol Moroz. I am a Full Stack Developer based in Eastern Europe.
In my everyday work, I write React.js with TypeScript, Elixir, and set up cloud infrastructure using Terraform.
In my spare time, I work with other technologies, including Node.js, Next.js, Rust, Go, and Swift/SwiftUI.

I enjoy learning new programming languages. I am currently trying to improve my Rust and I write back end servers
in Go for my clients.

You can find more about me on my website: [https://moroz.dev](https://moroz.dev).
